# Workshop Objectives

Our numerical weather prediction models now achieve very fine resolutions, yet the advantages of refined grids can become less obvious as the horizontal grid spacing approaches the hectometric scales. In this resolution regimeâ€”between Large-Eddy Simulations (commonly used for process studies and model development) and traditional mesoscale RANS simulations lies Wyngaard's 'Terra Incognita,' a grey zone where conventional turbulence parametrization assumptions are no longer hold. Grey-zone simulations are particularly sensitive to choices in subgrid or numerical diffusion, which directly influence the partially resolved flow field.

This workshop will explore the challenges and recent advances in grey-zone turbulence modeling, bringing together researchers to share ideas, insights, and foster stimulating discussions. We will also emphasize interdisciplinary perspectives on the LES/RANS grey zone, drawing from fields beyond Meteorology, including Engineering Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and broader Geophysical and Astrophysical modelling applications.
